# DataBases-Final-Project
This project aims to manage four different unstructured databases in a fictional scenario, using data generated by project members. Beyond the analysis and results underlying the data, the goal is to understand the operation of databases to achieve a solid basic proficiency in handling them. Additionally, the project involves developing a database system that leverages the various database management systems covered in class to address this issue.
